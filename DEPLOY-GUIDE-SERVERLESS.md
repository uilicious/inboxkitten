## Step 0 - Clone Me

```

### Step 1a - Setup Firebase

1. Go to <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a> and click on `Get Started`.
2. Sign in with your favorite Google account.
3. Click on `Add Project` and create your own Firebase inboxkitten project.
4. Remember the project ID.  

On your local machine where your InboxKitten is located at,
```
	# Go to the root folder of InboxKitten
	$ cd <the place where you clone your inboxkitten>
	
	# Ensure that firebase CLI tool is installed
	$ npm install -g firebase-tools
	
	# Login to your firebase account
	$ firebase login
	
	# Set your firebase project
	$ firebase use --add <project name that you remembered>

## Step 2 - Configuration

In the root directory of Inboxkitten, run the following command:
```
	$ ./config.sh
```

During the run time of `./config.sh`, there are three environment variables that are being used to set the configuration for your configuration files.

1. `MAILGUN_EMAIL_DOMAIN` - any custom domain that you owned or the default domain in Mailgun
2. `WEBSITE_DOMAIN`  - any custom domain that you owned. If you use your default firebase url, it will be `<Your project>.firebaseapp.com`
3. `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - retrieve the api key from your Mailgun account
