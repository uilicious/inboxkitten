## How to Setup Mailgun - and get your free API key

### Mailgun
To sign up for a Mailgun account, go to the <a href="https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup" target="_blank">signup</a> page.

> 2021 Update: Inbound routing for mailgun, now requires any paid account (starting at $35/month) see : https://www.mailgun.com/pricing/

#### Custom Domain
```
	1. Click on `Add New Domain` button under your Domains panel. 
	2. Follow the steps accordingly
```
> You can use the default domain that was provided by Mailgun if you do not have your own domain.

#### Routes Configuration
After setting up your domain, in order for you to receive email, you have to configure the routes. <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html" target="_blank">Routes</a> act as rules that will filter through all the incoming mails and execute actions on matched conditions.

In your Routes panel, simply click on `Create Route` button and follow the steps accordingly.

> The above route will match all names ending with `@inboxkitten.com`, store them in the storage that mailgun provides (only for 3 days) and stop processing any other rules once this route is matched. 

#### Mailgun API Key
You can locate your Mailgun API key by clicking on the domain that you are managing. In it you can see your API key.
