# Firebase Deployment Guide

## Step 0 - Clone Me

```
	$ git clone https://github.com/uilicious/inboxkitten.git
```

___

## Step 1 - Mailgun & Firebase signup

### Mailgun
To sign up for a Mailgun account, go to the <a href="https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup" target="_blank">signup</a> page.

#### Custom Domain
```
	1. Click on `Add New Domain` button under your Domains panel. 
	2. Follow the steps accordingly
```
> You can use the default domain that was provided by Mailgun if you do not have your own domain.

#### Routes Configuration
After setting up your domain, in order for you to receive email, you have to configure the routes. <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html" target="_blank">Routes</a> act as rules that will filter through all the incoming mails and execute actions on matched conditions.

In your Routes panel, simply click on `Create Route` button and follow the steps accordingly.

> The above route will match all names ending with `@inboxkitten.com`, store them in the storage that mailgun provides (only for 3 days) and stop processing any other rules once this route is matched. 

#### Mailgun API Key
You can locate your Mailgun API key by clicking on the domain that you are managing. In it you can see your API key.

Or you can go to the security settings and locate the API key there.

### Firebase

1. Go to <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a> and click on `Get Started`.
2. Sign in with your favorite Google account.
3. Click on `Add Project` and create your own firebase inboxkitten project.
4. Remember the project ID  

On your local machine where your InboxKitten is located at,
```
	# Go to the root folder of InboxKitten
	$ cd <the place where you clone your inboxkitten>
	
	# Ensure that firebase CLI tool is installed
	$ npm install -g firebase-tools
	
	# Login to your firebase account
	$ firebase login
	
	# Set your firebase project
	$ firebase use --add <project name that you remembered>
```

___

## Step 2 - Configuration

In the root directory of Inboxkitten, run the following command
```
	$ ./config.sh
```

During the run time of `./config.sh`, there are three environment variables that is being used to set the configuration for your configuration files.

1. `MAILGUN_EMAIL_DOMAIN` - any custom domain that you owned or the default domain in Mailgun
2. `WEBSITE_DOMAIN`  - any custom domain that you owned. If you use your default firebase url, it will be `<Your project>.firebaseapp.com`
3. `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - retrieve the api key from your Mailgun account

## Step 3 - Build the package

```
	$ ./build.sh
```

`./build.sh` will package the three components to be ready for deployment.

___

## Step 4 - Deployment

```
	# Run the deployment script
	$ ./deploy/firebase/deploy.sh 
```
---

# Developing on localhost

After running the `./config.sh` you can follow the steps below to run Inboxkitten on your localhost.

## Running api

```
	# Assuming that you are on the root directory of Inboxkitten
	$ cd api
	
	# Start the server
	$ npm start
```

## Running ui
```
	# Assuming that you are on the root directory of Inboxkitten
	$ cd ui
	
	# If you do not have a http server, you can install one
	$ npm run dev
```

You can now access it on `http://localhost:8080` and enjoy your kitten-ventures.

## Running cli

This is built using the `./build.sh` script

```
	# Assuming that you are on the root directory of Inboxkitten
	$ cd cli
	
	# You can immediately execute the executable
	$ ./bin/inboxkitten
	
	# Retrieving list of email
	$ ./bin/inboxkitten list exampleEmailName
	
	# Retrieving individual email
	$ ./bin/inboxkitten get sw eyJwIjpmYWxzZSwiayI6IjI3YzVkNmZkLTk5ZjQtNGY5MC1iYTM4LThiNDBhNTJmNzA1OCIsInMiOiI0NzFhZjYxYjA4IiwiYyI6InRhbmtiIn0=
	
	# Target different api endpoint
	$ ./bin/inboxkitten -api http://localhost:8800/api/v1 (list|get) [params]             
```
To run without compilation of `inboxkitten.go` in the src/ folder
```
	$ ./go.sh run src/inboxkitten.go
```

## Calling the API using curl
If you have your API running on port `8800`,
```
	# Get list of email
	$ curl localhost:8800/api/v1/mail/list\?recipient=hard-dust-64

	# Get individual email
	$ curl localhost:8800/api/v1/mail/list\?mailKey=se-eyJwIjpmYWxzZSwiayI6ImVlMWNiMTAzLWZhZjMtNDg3Ni04MjI2LWE1YmE1ZTU3YzMxMiIsInMiOiI3NTdhNTY5ZGFkIiwiYyI6InRhbmtiIn0=
```

If you have it hosted on the net, change the endpoint to where you have hosted it on :)

# Code Guide
If you are interested to developing Inboxkitten, this is a brief guide of how  Inboxkitten has been structured.

## Main Components
 - API - that serves as the backbone to connect to MailGun
 - UI - the user interface that you see on <a href="https://inboxkitten.com" target="_blank">Inboxkitten</a> that interacts with the API
 - CLI - the command line tool that you can use to interact with the API

### API
Under the `api` folder is where all the code resides for the API component. The API component utilizes `axios` to perform its requests to Mailgun.

- The configuration settings of the API are all located under `config/`
    - `mailgunConfig.js` is the configuration file that contains the keys and domains 
    - `mailgunConfig.sample.js` is the template that `./config.sh` used to write into `mailgunConfig.js`
- The rest of the code resides in `src/`.
    - The main point of entry in an ExpressJS setup is at `app-setup.js`. In this file, 
    - `mailgunReader.js` contains the underlying code that connects to Mailgun
    - the `api` folder will contain the code that performs the validation of the params in the endpoint that the user called before sending over to `mailgunReader.js`.
- The `test` folder contains the mocha test cases to check the `mailgunReader.js`.

To add any endpoints, it is recommended to create a prototype function in `mailgunReader.js` that performs the execution that connects to Mailgun. Following which, you should create the endpoint that user will be using as a new file under `src/api/` folder for easy maintenance.

### UI
The UI component code is under `ui` folder. It is constructed using Vue.js for its frontend development and `axios` to perform to requests to API component.

- The configuration settings of the UI are all located under `config/`
    - `apiconfig.js` contains the configuration for connecting to API component as well as the domain to display on the UI.
    - `apiconfig.sample.js` is the template used in `./config.sh` for writing into `apiconfig.js`
    - The other configuration to be concerned would be the `shareConfig.js` where it is the settings for shareable features such as Twitter's tweeting and GitHub's fork.
    - The other files are auto generated files by vue-cli.
- The `src` folder contains the body for UI. It is separated into 3 folders.
    - The `assets` will contain the images.
    - The `components` will contain the components used in the UI.
    - The `router` is an auto generated file but it is used to add subpaths to link to the components.
    - The `scss` contains the styling used for Inboxkitten's UI.
- The `dist` folder contains the files built using the `npm run build` command.
- The `uilicious-test` is an uilicious test script that can be ran on [test.uilicious.com](https://test.uilicious.com) to check if your email has been received properly.

The main entrypoint will be the `App.vue` and by default the Vue router will direct to `landingpage.vue`.


### CLI
The CLI is under the `cli` folder. There are only one file that performs the tasks to connect to the API component. It is `inboxkitten.go` under the `src` folder. The `go.sh` script is a custom go script that ensures the environment is within the `cli` folder.
